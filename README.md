# locker-database
A simple badly written website for tracking lockers.

# Get started  
1. Install Docker
2. modify the docker-compose to fit your needs
3. docker compose up -d
4. Go to phpmyadmin and import DB lockers.sql
5. update config.php with your DB details
6. go to the server IP.

# Limitations  
This is for internal team use, there is no authentication and little attribution on an entry change, this was by design to be ran in an offline environment e.g. forensics labs.

# Support  
Feel free to submit PR's but I am not supporting this per say if you have issues running it, you will need some knowledge of PHP.
